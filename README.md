## üöó BREMOLA: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment for Autonomous Driving

## üìå Overview
This repository provides the implementation of **BREMOLA** (Blind/Referenceless Model via Moving Spectrum and Laplacian Filter), a **No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA)** method tailored for **autonomous driving environments**. BREMOLA is designed to accurately assess image quality degradation, particularly **blur**, in real-time driving scenarios by leveraging a **Fourier transform-based shifted spectrum** and **Laplacian filter for edge detection**.

## üèÜ Key Features
- **No-Reference IQA**: Evaluates image quality without needing a reference image.
- **Real-Time Adaptability**: Designed for rapidly changing autonomous driving environments.
- **Fourier Transform-based Shifted Spectrum**: Quantifies image sharpness loss due to blur.

### **Comparison Before and After Applying BREMOLA**  
**Before applying BREMOLA**, NR-IQA methods based on moving spectrum analysis showed **high variability in quality metric values due to environmental factors (lighting, number of objects, etc.)**, especially for **low blur levels (1√ó1 to 5√ó5 filters)**. In particular, **overlapping metric values between 1√ó1 (original) and 3√ó3 (mild blur) made it difficult to distinguish normal and degraded conditions**. However, **after applying BREMOLA, the Laplacian filter was used to compensate for image complexity**, reducing variance in quality metrics and **providing a more consistent decrease in values as blur increased**, making it easier to identify degraded images.

### **Comparison with Traditional IQA Metrics**  
PSNR and SSIM, as **Full-Reference IQA (FR-IQA) methods, require an original reference image**, making them unsuitable for autonomous driving. **BRISQUE, a No-Reference IQA (NR-IQA) method, was highly sensitive to environmental changes**, leading to **inconsistent quality assessments influenced more by image complexity than actual blur**. In contrast, **BREMOLA is robust to environmental variations and provides a reliable measure of blur**, making it **better suited for real-time camera sensor monitoring in autonomous driving environments**. üöóüí°

---
BREMOLA demonstrates **higher reliability and accuracy** in detecting blur degradation compared to traditional IQA metrics such as:
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**
- **GMSD (Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation)**
- **BRISQUE (Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator)**

| Method  | Performance on Driving Images |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| **BREMOLA**  | ‚úÖ Stable, accurate, and robust |
| PSNR    | ‚ùå Sensitive to noise, low robustness |
| SSIM    | ‚ùå Requires reference images |
| GMSD    | ‚ùå Unstable for varying conditions |
| BRISQUE | ‚ùå High variance in real-world driving |

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset consists of **real-world driving images** from various sources, covering:
- **Different times of day**
- **Urban and highway scenarios**
- **Diverse environmental factors (buildings, vehicles, pedestrians, lighting conditions)**
